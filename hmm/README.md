# hmm models for nba game outcomes trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

- **files**
  - `hmm_model.py`: supervised training utilities for a discrete-emission hmm
    - `train_supervised_hmm()` trains the model using known win/loss states and binned observation symbols to estimate:
      - initial state distribution `pi`
      - state transition matrix `A`
      - emission matrix `B`
    - `sequence_accuracy()` computes simple per-game accuracy between true and predicted state sequences
  - `hmm_viterbi.py`: implementation of the viterbi decoding algorithm
    - `viterbi()` runs single-sequence viterbi in log space
    - `viterbi_on_sequences()` applies viterbi to a list of observation sequences
  - `preprocess.py`: data preprocessing and sequence construction from csv data
    - reads per-game stats from a csv (see `data/README.md` for expected schema)
    - computes per-season factor statistics
    - standardizes four factors and bins them into discrete observation symbols
    - groups games into sequences per team-season and splits into train / test sets
  - `run_hmm.py`: simple script for cli training + evaluation
    - uses `build_sequences_from_csv()` to construct sequences
    - trains the supervised hmm
    - decodes test sequences with viterbi and prints test accuracy
